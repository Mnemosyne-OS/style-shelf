/**
 * detect — finds out whether Style Shelf runs inside Mnemosyne OS (doc 186, the way of doc 166 §4).
 *
 * One question, `getStatus`, which every host answers without a permission.
 * The answer is awaited for a long while, but the app is not held for it:
 * after `settleMs` with no answer it is told « foreign » and works on its own.
 *
 * 🎭 No answer yet is not « no »: a slow host that answers after `settleMs`
 * still turns the app into its Mnemosyne state, it does not leave the
 * integrated features off for the session.
 *
 * A copy of Lab 3D's host/detect.ts: doc 166 plans `detectHost()` in the SDK,
 * and moving it there is a publication of the SDK (Tony's call).
 *
 * @module host/detect
